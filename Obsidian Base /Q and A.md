is any possibility to take "samskara" [[සංඛාරා]] as feelings?

In Buddhism, samskara (also spelled sankhara) is a mental formation or mental construct. It refers to a mental state that is conditioned by past experiences and that shapes our perceptions and understanding of reality. Samskaras are often thought of as being responsible for the creation of our habits, tendencies, and biases.

In some Buddhist texts, samskaras are described as being closely related to #feelings or #emotions. According to this understanding, samskaras are the underlying impulses or tendencies that give rise to our emotional responses. Thus, samskaras can be thought of as the unconscious impulses that shape our emotional experiences.

Samskaras are considered to be an important aspect of the Buddhist understanding of the mind and consciousness. They are considered to be a [driving force] behind the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth known as samsara. It is through the cultivation of wisdom and the cultivation of compassion that one can overcome the influence of samskaras and achieve liberation.

It's important to note that the interpretation of samskaras can vary between different schools of Buddhism, so it's always best to refer to the specific context or tradition to understand the concept more accurately.
